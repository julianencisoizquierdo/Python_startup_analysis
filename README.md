# Startup Analysis with Python

## Content of the project
The purpose of this project is to showcase my data analysis skills in Python. Along the project, I try to derive insightful observations from the main dataset.
QUESTION 1: What are the most successful universities?
QUESTION 2: Which sectors are the most successful ones?
QUESTION 3: For how long should I expect to stay private?
QUESTION 4: What country is more suited for creating a startup?
QUESTION 5: How much financing am I expected to obtain?


- Which university should I go to?
- What are the most appealing sectors?
- How long should I expect to stay private? How does that expected time change from sector to sector?
- Where should I locate my firm?
- How much financing am I expected to get? How does that depend on the funding stage and on the country?

## Instructions
The main file used for the analysis is Startup_Dataset.xlsx. This workbook contains four worksheets:
- COMPANY: contains information about different companies, including their category, the revenue range, and the employee count
- INVESTMENT: includes information about the financing rounds that companies in the previous sheet have gone through
- ACQUISITION: contains information about the acquisitions completed by some of the firms contained in the sheet COMPANIES
- EMPLOYEE: includes information about the University attended by professionals that work in some of the companies included in the dataset

Additionally, three csv files are needed in order to run the code properly:
- Exchange_Rates_Table.csv
- world-universities.csv
- GDP Per Capita All countries.csv

## Installation
